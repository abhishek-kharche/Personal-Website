<hr><li><h2>Android Programming - Independent Study</h2></li>
<p class="ex1">An ongoing project based on <b>Android Programming</b> under the supervision of Prof. Stephan Bohacek. The objective of project was to determine user's physical location based of accelerometer and Longitude/Latitude values. Finally trace an <b>itinerary for user's day activity</b>. <a href="https://github.com/abhishek-kharche/LocationRetrieval-Android">[GitHub]</a></p>
<hr><li><h2>Information Retrieval for Text Analysis</h2></li>
<p class="ex1">This is the project to implement Information Retrieval for <b>Text Analysis</b>. I used open source Java Software jEdit4.3 for analyzing the text content inside methods. The project extracts the method contents from the source and create a corpus of terms after <b>splitting and stemming</b> the words. This corpus is then parsed and similarity against user queries for each document is found. These results are then compared against the GoldSets which are the sets evaluated by someone in past years.<br><b>Scripting Language:-</b> Perl, Java, Shell scripting. <a href="https://github.com/abhishek-kharche/Information_Retrieval_For_Text_Analysis">[GitHub]</a></p>

The objective of a project was to obtain <b>UML</b> and other design diagrams from source code to assist developers. An extension was provided to the existing software for better GUI using <b>Java Swings and AWT</b> packages. <a href="https://github.com/abhishek-kharche/Reverse_Engineering_-Java-">[GitHub]</a></p>
<hr><li><h2>Book My Ticket</h2></li>
<p class="ex1">A project to design & build a <b>website for travel agency</b>. Customers can register themselves on a website, select several packages for tours & book them.

<hr><li><h2>Character Writing Robot</h2></li>
<p class="ex1">A <b>final year</b> project based on <b>'Robotics'</b> which allows the robot to write characters on page by holding a pen using <b>'Rack and Pinion'</b> arrangement.
